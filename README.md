# KeyLogger

KeyLogger is a simple Python program built with the pynput library. The program tracks pressed keys, records the duration and intervals between key presses, and saves this information to a text file.

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

▶️ Run the program:
    ```
    python keylogger.py
    ```

🛑 To stop the keylogger, press the 'Esc' key.


## 📑 **Saved Data**
After stopping the keylogger, the data is saved to a text file named registered_keys_date_and_time.txt, where "date_and_time" is the exact date and time the program was launched.

**The resulting file includes the following information:**

⌛ Total duration of keylogger operation. <br>
🔠 Pressed key, duration of the press, and the time interval from the previous key.<br>
