# KeyLogger

KeyLogger is a simple Python program built with the pynput library. The program tracks pressed keys, records the duration and intervals between key presses, and saves this information to a text file.

## 🚀 How to Run

📦 Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

▶️ Run the program:
    ```
    python keylogger.py
    ```

🛑 To stop the keylogger, press the 'Esc' key.

📑 Saved Data
After stopping the keylogger, the data is saved to a text file named registered_keys_date_and_time.txt, where "date_and_time" is the exact date and time the program was launched.

The resulting file includes the following information:

⌛ Total duration of keylogger operation.
